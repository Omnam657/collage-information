    <h1>MECHANICAL ENGGINEERING</h1>
    <p font face="times new roman" size="7">Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines.
        Mechanical engineers design, develop, build, and test.
        They deal with anything that moves, from components to machines to the human body
        Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of
        engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object.
        Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs
        function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost. </p>

    <p font face="times new roman" size="7">Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical
        engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs.
        Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer
        to help humankind.

        This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation,
        world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.

        Being ingrained in many challenges and innovations across many fields means a mechanical engineering education
        is versatile. To meet this broad demand, mechanical engineers may design a component, a machine, a system, or a
        process.
        This ranges from the macro to the micro, from the largest systems like cars and satellites to the smallest
        components like sensors and switches. Anything that needs to be manufactured—indeed, anything with moving
        parts—needs the expertise of a mechanical engineer.</p>

    <h2>Automobile engineering</h2>
    <p font-size="7"><i>Automobile engineering is a branch study of engineering which teaches manufacturing, designing,
            mechanical mechanisms as well as operations of automobiles.
            It is an introduction to vehicle engineering which deals with motorcycles, cars, buses, trucks, etc.
            Traveling on horses, elephants, and bullock carts is a history. Nowadays, high-speed cars are in trend and
            many upgraded vehicles are in the making. Transportation is one of the biggest contributors to the economy.
            In the fast-paced world, it is important to have vehicles that help you reach your destination well within
            time. But, who looks after this and works on the technology? It is the engineers.</i>
