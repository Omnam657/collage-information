        <p face="Times New Roman" font size="4">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup
            language
            for web page creation.
            It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building
            blocks
            of a web page)
            such as tags and attributes.

        <h3><u>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:</u></h3>

        <h4> Web development:</h4> Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as
        text, hyperlinks, and media files.
        <h4>Internet navigation:</h4> Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as
        HTML
        is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
        <h4>Web documentation:</h4> HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft
        Word.
        </p>

        <p face="Times New Roman" font size="4">The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance,
            a
            home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.

            HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and
            renders
            its content so that internet users can view it.

            All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are
            the
            building blocks of a web page.
            A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the
            characteristics
            of an element.

    <h4>The three main parts of an element are:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Opening tag</li> used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening
        and
        closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag to create a paragraph.
        <li>Content </li> this is the output that other users see.
        <li>Closing tag </li>the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For
        example,
        to end a paragraph.
    </ol>
    <h4>Types of tag in html</h4>

    <ul type="squre">
        <li>Paired Tags</li>An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a
        closing
        tag as its companion tag. An HTML Paired tag starts with an opening tag: the tag name enclosed inside the
        angle
        brackets
        <li>Unpaired Tags</li>An HTML tag is called an unpaired tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does
        not
        have a closing tag or a companion tag. The Unpaired HTML tag does not require a closing tag; an opening tag
        is
        sufficient in this type.
        Unpaired tags are sometimes also named as Standalone Tags or Singular Tags since they do not require a
        companion
        tag.
        <li> Self-Closing Tags</li>Self-Closing Tags are those HTML tags that do not have a partner tag, where the
        first
        tag is the only necessary tag that is valid for the formatting. The main and important information is
        contained
        WITHIN the element as its attribute.
        An image tag is a classic example of a self-closing tag.
        <li>Formatting Tag</li>The HTML tags that help us in the formatting of the texts like the size of the text,
        font
        styles, making a text bold, etc.
    </ul>
